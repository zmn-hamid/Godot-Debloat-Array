# [Beta] Debloat Exported Arrays Addon for Godot

![screenshot1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c57f798-2ae9-4327-8dca-bc8cbd3e684a)

This plugin debloats the exported Arrays by removing the `Size:` and `> Resource` fields.

Attributes to (kleonc)[https://github.com/kleonc] for basically
writing the whole plugin. I've just gathered his code into a plugin.

This is the beta version because the method used is a hacky one and might not work
for the previous versions out of box. The issue can be seen in godotengine/godot#106576.

> Works with Godot 4.4 - other versions not tested

## How To Use

1. Install and activate the addon
2. Reload the project: Project > Reload Current Project
3. Now you're good to go. check the example scene to see the results.
